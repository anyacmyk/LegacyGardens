        <p class="profile-text" sty>
          Legacy Gardens is a serene online space where you can create a
          personalized memorial to honor and celebrate the life of your loved
          one. With our interactive platform, you can design a virtual tribute
          that reflects their spirit, using custom photos, heartfelt messages,
          and beautiful elements like flowers, which you can simply drag and
          drop onto the memorial page.<br /><br />

          At Legacy Gardens, we believe that memories deserve to be cherished in
          a way that fosters healing and reflection. Our core values of
          compassion, respect, and remembrance are at the heart of everything we
          do. We offer families a meaningful way to keep the legacy of their
          loved ones alive, creating a lasting digital garden where stories,
          emotions, and memories can bloom.<br /><br />

          We are committed to providing a peaceful and supportive environment,
          where each memorial is unique, and where family and friends can visit
          and contribute anytime. At Legacy Gardens, we believe in the power of
          memories and the beauty of shared connections. Let us help you build a
          space of love, peace, and eternal remembrance.

          <b>Photos 1914 - 1918:</b> This data comes from the queensland
          goverment and contains images from 1914-1918. The solider images,
          names and descriptions have come from this dataset. Any additional
          data that the user creates will be stores locally. As there is a
          subject column in this dataset, the soldier portraits are filtered by
          this so only them can be shown.

        <p class="profile-text">
          <b>Wildlife:</b> This data comes from ALA or the Atlas of Living
          Australia. It has information about flora and fauna of Australia and
          the regions that they come from. Images provided from the dataset will
          also be used to show what the flower will look like.
